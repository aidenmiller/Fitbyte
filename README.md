## Synopsis
FitByte is a Desktop application that allows a user to track their fitness. The user's activity is recorded by their personal Fitbit device and displayed on the FitByte application.

The application connects to [Fitbit's API](https://dev.fitbit.com/) and uses the [ScribeJava](https://github.com/scribejava/scribejava) library for OAuth2 authentication and API response handling. The [JFreeChart](http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/) library is also used to show Time Series Data for various user activity.
